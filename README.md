# Classes Practice – NOVI Backend Java Assignment

## About the Project

This repository contains my solution to the **Classes** assignment from the Backend Java module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).

The goal of this project is to practice working with **Java classes**, **constructors** and **objects**. By creating multiple a custom `Dog`, `DogOwner`, `Address` and `House` class, this assignment demonstrates how to model real-world entities in code using object-oriented principles.
